<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Jeji Ramchand Vedullapalli, and welcome to my 
page. I'd like to use this page to tell you a little bit more 
about me and my interests.  I'll be adding more information 
as I get around to it.</p>

<h2>Where am I from?</h2>

<p>I am from Eluru, a beautiful place in India. The village is astonishing. It radiates an ora of peace and serenity as birds chirp to their families and the villagers diligently work to gather food for a bountiful feast.
 The village huts smell of damp wood and exemplify a modest lifestyle. 
Trees tower over the entire village, their broad, green leaves providing shade from the radiant sun.

<h3>More about me?</h3>

<p>I am a jovial and down-to-earth kind of guy. I yearn to experience everything in life. I truly believe the quote - No Pain! No Gain!. 
</p>
<h2>My Family</h2>

<ul>
<li>Parents: Live in India</li>
<li>Pets: Snowy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My favorite. I treat her like my sister.</li>
</ul>

<p>What have I learned after coming to GSU?</p>
<h4> Swimming. Yayy!! </h4>
